  <h1>More about Isaiah</h1>
  <p> I grew up in Windsor, Ct. Growing up in Windsor I didn't have much to do. I often spent time with my friends outside. We rode our bikes for hours and hours. During the summer, bike-riding was our main form of entertainment. We loved it. As I entered high school I got facsianted with art. I always loved to doodle, but in high school I took it more seriously. Senior year I decided I wanted to become an art major. So I applied all over, I was accepted by Uhart, and decided to go here. Once I got into the guts of the program I realized it wasn't enough, I felt like I was wasting my time. So, I found a compremise, I decided to mix my art skills with a new thing, computer science. Now Im doing HCID, where its the best of both worlds.</p>
  <p>Some hobbies i've had over the years are video games, music, and drawing. As a kid, playing Call of Duty with my older cousin was the coolest. My role model letting me play a game for adults? Why wouldn't I enjoy every moment of that? Drawing,like I said, will always have a place in my heart. There were days I would draw and draw just to reduce stress. Its more than a hobby for me, its relief. Furthermore, it now provides me with a career path. My third hobby, music, has became my favorite. I started of making stupid songs on Garage Band, to making serious records in a studio. I find the process of making songs highly enjoyable. Finishing a record is such a good feeling.</p>
