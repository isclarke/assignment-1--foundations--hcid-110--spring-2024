<h1>About me</h1>
<p> I'm a sophmore and i'm studying HCID. I first came to school to do art, however, computers always interested me. So why not mix both! I've been learning to code since last term, I find it challenging, yet super fun. Im hoping to become a UI desinger, or a software engineer  </p>
